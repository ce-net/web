//! The mirroring client — `rdev watch` reimplemented over the Drive API.
//!
//! A client that wants to *mirror* (not just browse) a remote drive bootstraps a local
//! [`ce_drive_core::Drive`] replica from the `Open` snapshot CID (so it starts in O(snapshot), not
//! O(log)), then keeps it live: subscribe to the change beacon, and on each wake (or periodically,
//! since the beacon is lossy) call `Poll` for deltas since its cursor and apply them. The cursor is
//! the source of truth; the beacon is only a latency hint.
//!
//! The bootstrap snapshot is a serialized [`ce_drive_core::DriveState`] (the move-op + content-op
//! logs); replaying it reconstructs the [`DriveTree`](ce_drive_core::DriveTree) + content map exactly.
